/**
 * Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle Algorithm works in O(n) time complexity. The assumption here is, we are given
 * a function rand() that generates random number in O(1) time.
 * The idea is to start from the last element, swap it with a randomly selected element from the whole
 * array (including last). Now consider the array from 0 to n-2 (size reduced by 1), and repeat the
 * process till we hit the first element.

 *Following is the detailed algorithm

  To shuffle an array a of n elements (indices 0..n-1):
    for i from n - 1 down to 1 do
         j = random integer with 0 <= j <= i
         exchange a[j] and a[i]
